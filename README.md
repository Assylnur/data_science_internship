# Data science Internship 

During the internship, the main tasks were to create a search engine that filters data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users, and build an algorithm for predicting the changes in inflation or dollar exchange rate using the publication of reports and speeches of the National bank.

###  I. TASK 1: Creation of a search engine for residential complexes
Subtasks for the first task:
-	With Selenium in Python, automated web browser to access data on the website, collect and store data in CSV file.

###  II. TASK 2: Building an algorithm for predicting the changes in inflation and dollar exchange rate
Subtasks for the second main task:
-	Collect and store data in CSV file from the official website of National Bank.
